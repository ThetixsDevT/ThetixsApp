 is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and
 online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches 
well beyond California to require any person or company in the United 
States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting 
Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a 
conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the 
information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom
 it is being shared. -  See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">http://consumercal.org/<wbr>california-online-privacy-<wbr>protection-act-caloppa/#<wbr>sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a><br></div><div><br><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong><br></div><div>Users can visit our site anonymously.</div><div>Once

 it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 
the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
(COPPA) puts parents in control.  The Federal Trade Commission, United 
States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which 
spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to 
protect children's privacy and safety online.<br><br></div><div>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</div><span></span><br><div><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></div><br><div>The
 Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law 
in the United States and the concepts they include have played a 
significant role in the development of data protection laws around the 
globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how 
they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various 
privacy laws that protect personal information.<br><br></div><div><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></div><div>We will notify you via email</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Within 7 business days</div><div>We will notify the users via in-site notification</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Within 7 business days</div><div><br>We
 also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that 
individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against 
data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This 
principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights 
against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
 government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by 
data processors.</div><span></span><br><div><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></div><br><div>The
 CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, 
establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the 
right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out 
tough penalties for violations.<br><br></div><div><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Send you additional information related to your product and/or service</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</div><div><br><strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</div><div><strong><br>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email.</div> and we will promptly remove you from <strong>ALL</strong> correspondence.</div><br><span></span><br><div><strong>Contacting Us</strong></div><br><div>If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us using the information below.<br><br></div><div><a href="http://thetixs.com/" target="_blank">thetixs.com</a></div><div>1900 n bayshore dr</div>MIami, Fl 33132 <div>United States</div><div><a href="mailto:info@thetixs.com" target="_blank">info@thetixs.com</a></div><div><br>Last Edited on 2017 - 2018-02-28</div></body>
